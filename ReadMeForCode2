This code is used to obtain Tumble or CW bias as a function of mu, the steady state molar concentration.

	For CW bias:
	
		In definiciones.h change:
			
			nfla=1;
			If you can run this code in differnt threads or in a cluster we recommend to use nbac=10 and perform several independent runs of the code.
			If not, we recommend using nbac=100; Although depends on your computer speed.

	For Tumble bias:

		The  code is already set to obtain the Tumble bias for 3 flagella ---> nfla=3;
		If you  want to run the code to obtain the Tumble bias for other number of flagella just change nfla to the number you want in definiciones.h	


The data will be saved in savefilesCheypBias.dat where the columns are

	
	First column: Mu of the first flagella of the first bacteria
	Second column: bias averaged over the ensamble
	Third column: mean Run time averaged over the ensamble
	Fourth column: mean Tumble time averaged over the ensamble
	Fifth column: Standard deviation of Run times averaged over the ensamble
	Sixth column: Standard deviation of Tumble times averaged over the ensamble

Before changing the steady state molar concentration (mu) when time reach dtickshut, the code saves the data and reboots changing mu with double deltaMU=0.1, where both can be modified as you want in definiciones.c .
The code will end when mu reachs double MUcut=4.0 .
